# Barcode_Scanner_Project

A Barcode Scanner Application that would replace old handheld scanners
for warehouse inventory management. 

It needed to be as simplistic a spossible to ease employee workload. Backend handles 
database and management issues and sends reponses. The app only needed to know
if the barcode was added to the database successfully.

Due to the scanner limitations and older Android software the app needed to be
compatible with android 5.0 and above.
